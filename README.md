# Bootstrapping
I am really proud of my updated portfolio! This is the first project I've made that I am proud to show potential employers, aesthetically speaking. 

Even though the javascript is solid on the projects I included in my portfolio, my next goal is to go back through and make my programs more visually appealing.
